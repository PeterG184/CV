Throughout my career, I have thrived in the dynamic environment of a fast-paced startup, excelling in rapid development cycles and meeting tight deadlines.}

% work experience
\section*{Work Experience}
\work{Research Software Engineer}{April 2024--Present}{University of York}{I work across multiple projects. I and the lead developer in the implementation of a solar panel data tracking dashboard, designing the database, developing the APIs for access and creating the frontend for visualisation, as well as using machine learning techniques for predicting energy generation and usage. I also develop software for experiments involving embedded networking devices, working to test jamming attacks and developing countermeasures to them.}
\work{Software Engineer}{August 2023--February 2024}{Premium Lithium}{I have worked across many disciplines in this role, developing full stack web applications, leading multiple projects in operations management and internal statistic tracking, and implementing AI applications for energy arbitrage and solar panel detection. It was a fast paced start up requiring me to manage my time effectively, meet ever changing requirements and deadlines, and work as part of an agile team.}
\work{Production Operator}{October 2021--August 2023}{DJ Assembly}{I worked in all areas of production and manufacturing of electronic goods, including circuit assembly, equipment building, and inspection, testing and validation. I also gained experience in managing outgoing and internal stock and logistics.}
